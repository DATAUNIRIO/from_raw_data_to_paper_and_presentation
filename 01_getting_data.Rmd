I found data of interest put together for us already in Brian Weinstein's github repository. https://github.com/BrianWeinstein/state-of-the-union

I ended up forking the repository.  I want to know that the data won't disappear if he deletes his repository or account. I think forking adresses that.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EvaMaeRey/state-of-the-union/master/transcripts.csv

Now, we'll do a conditional download.  If we've downloaded the csv already, R will skip this step. 

```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EvaMaeRey/state-of-the-union/master/transcripts.csv"

if (!file.exists("raw_data/transcripts.csv")) {
  download.file(url = url, destfile = "raw_data/transcripts.csv")
  }
```


```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
