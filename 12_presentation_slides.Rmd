# Abstract

- State of the Union addresses are a classic corpus for students of text analysis. 
- In this paper you'll see time-in-year by year plots and a model of the timing.  


---


- Motivation for addressing this question actually comes from Kenneth Benoit who conducted a quick [analysis](https://twitter.com/kenbenoit/status/1088304778088566785) on this question.

# Introduction

The 2019 government shutdown had many people wondering, when will US State of the Union address be delivered by the President.  Would it be pushed later than what is considered "normal."

# Literature Review



```{r, load_refs, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
library(RefManageR)
BibOptions(check.entries = FALSE, 
           bib.style = "authoryear", 
           cite.style = 'alphabetic', 
           style = "markdown",
           hyperlink = FALSE, 
           dashed = FALSE)
myBib <- ReadBib("./literature/bibliography.bib", check = FALSE)
```

The texts of the State of the Union addresses have been studied by scholars including Benoit, Munger and Spirling; they offer an interesting analysis of State of the Union addresses by US presidents, noting that SOTU that are not delivered orally tend to use more complex language. There are several R text analysis packages .  These entries are included in the literature/bibliography.bib document that is referenced in the YMAL.

# Theory and Hypotheses

This analysis was exploratory.  It is well known that modern SOTU addresses are delivered early in the year.  After plotting the data, what seemed to matter was year of delivery, and if the SOTU followed an election year.  We tried to follow the advice in the e-book [The Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz).

Data visualization categories from *"The Fundamentals of Data Visualization."*

# Data 

Last 8 presidents:


```{r nice-tab}
library(tidyverse)
# load cleaned data
load("data_products/sotu_texts.Rdata")
sotu_texts_mod <- sotu_texts %>% 
  mutate(president = fct_inorder(president)) %>% 
  group_by(president) %>% tally() %>% 
  rename(President = president) %>% 
  rename(`Number of Addresses` = n) 

knitr::kable(sotu_texts_mod %>% head(8), format = "html")
```

# Analysis

## Visualization of relationships

```{r year, fig.cap = "Timing of state of the union by year.  SOTUs that follow election years are colored with blue.", out.width='\\textwidth', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/sotu_timing_delivery.png")
```


<!-- In figure \@ref(fig:year) we use LOESS smoothing to summarize the relationship between year and time in year for the categories "following election year" and "not following".  In the linear modelling exercise below, we remove the 1973 cases, given that they are so unusual --- in light of the Nixon impeachment, there were multiple SOTU's delivered that year.  -->

---


<!-- If compiling to html: -->

<!-- We load the models that we've estimated and save out,then prepare the table using stargazer.  -->

```{r regtable_html, results = "asis"}
# load models that have been saved in .Rdata file previously
load("data_products/models.Rdata")
stargazer::stargazer(lateness_by_year,
                     lateness_following_election, lateness_full, lateness_full_interaction,
                     dep.var.labels = "Days elapsed since January 1st",
                     covariate.labels = c("year", "post election", "year*post election"),
                     title = "Models of time elapsed in year before State of the Union Address", omit.stat = c("all"),
                     style = "qje",
                     type = "html")
```




R^2 is `r round(summary(lateness_full_interaction)$r.squared, 3)`.

---

The full model formula with the interaction is:


$$ DaysSinceJan1 = $$
$$\beta_0  + \beta_1YEAR + B_2FollowingElection + B_3Year*FollowingElection + \epsilon $$

## Visualization

```{r, fig.cap = "Timing of state of the union by year.  SOTUs that follow election years are colored with blue.",  out.width='\\textwidth', fig.align='center'}
# Include the figure that you have saved out in working files
knitr::include_graphics("figures/sotu_timing_model.png")
```




---

# Conclusion


- State of the Union addresses, in general are being delivered later and later

--

- SOTU addresses are delivered later if they follow an election year

--

- The 2019 State of the Union timing is not a unusual departure from the trend
